# Summarizer

A Summarizer made using React is a web application that uses the React framework to provide a user interface for summarizing text. The application typically allows users to enter or upload a block of text and then generates a summary of the most important points from that text. The summarization is usually done using natural language processing techniques such as text clustering and ranking algorithms. The React framework is used to create a responsive and interactive user interface that allows users to interact with the application easily. Overall, a Summarizer made using React provides a quick and efficient way to extract the most important information from a large block of text..
